Installation Instructions for PyEvolve

PyEvolve provides the Python package evo, a collection of classes for analyzing
sequence evolution.

This document will describe the installation procedure for the evo package
when this procedure exists. For now, add PyEvolve/lib/python-code to your
PYTHONPATH to make the evo package and its component modules available for
import.

Adding a directory to your path:

  bash: export PYTHONPATH='/full/path/to/PyEvolve/lib/python-code'
  tcsh: setenv PYTHONPATH '/full/path/to/PyEvolve/lib/python-code'
  Windows:
    Open RegEdit (regedit at command prompt)
    Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Python\PythonCore\2.3\PythonPath
    Add a new key (right click -> New -> Key) with the name PyEvolve
    Click on the folder for the new key and edit its Default value
      (right click -> Modify) and type in the full path of your directory

To check that the path has been added:
  Open the interpreter
  from sys import path
  print path

You should see the python-code directory near the start of your path.
